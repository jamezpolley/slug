# Initial Configuration

To get the code and dependencies::

  git clone git@github.com:mithro/slug.git
  cd slug
  ./init_third_party.sh

# Installing django 1.2.5

We use django1.2.5, which is bundled with the SDK.

You don't gots to do nothing.

# Running appserver on a mac

We need to use python2.6, not python2.7. ``make server`` will start the dev appserver using python2.6 for you.

# Adding third-party libraries

 - Edit the init-third-party script to download and unpack your library
 - edit third-party/mkzip to include the neccessary portions of the unpacked library in the zip
 - edit config.py to include the library in the sys.path
 - run ``make 3p`` to update ``third_party.zip`` using your updated scripts

# Pushing to appengine

 - If neccessary, increment version number in app.cfg to make sure you don't trample on the currently-live version of the app
 - run ``make update`` to push to server
