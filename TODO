Polleyj:
- Fix "publishing"
 - Don't just set a flag to "published" - create an "announcement" object with the text/html at time of announcement
 - event model has an "announcement" field which stores the key of most recent announcement
 - so that website can easily get at the most recent announcement for any given event
 - Allows admins to edit and get things right before re-publishing
 - RSS - use guid of announcement, so a re-publish means it shows up in feeds again
 - ical - use guid of event; ical programs will notice changed description. I think.
- Export attendees list for organisers (polleyj)

BUGS:
 - event/<<id>>/edit page should *not* display list of future dates.
 - but should have "create another event" button.

- Automate announcement/reminder emails
Track number of confirmed attendees
Display number of confirmed attendees somewhere interesting
Subscribe to announce list while registering for event
Share buttons - fbook, twitter, etc
