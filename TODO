Polleyj:
- Add "Published" status to Events
  - future/current/next events should only return published events by default
  - optionally return all events - only for admins
  - clicking button to send "announce" email changes state to "published"
- Export attendees list for organisers (polleyj)

BUGS:
 - event/<<id>>/edit page should *not* display list of future dates.
 - but should have "create another event" button.

- Automate announcement/reminder emails
Track number of confirmed attendees
Display number of confirmed attendees somewhere interesting
Subscribe to announce list while registering for event
Share buttons - fbook, twitter, etc
